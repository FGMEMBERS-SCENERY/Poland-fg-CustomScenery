GCXO - Tenerife North Airport
----------------------------------

Thanks for downloading this airport scenery. Of course the download is free and falls under the GNU-license.

How to install?
---------------
Copy or unzip all files from the download into the following folder: data -> Scenery -> Objects -> w020n20 -> w017n28.
Important is that you have to replace the stg-file named "2678170" otherwise it won't work later.

If there are any requests or problems you can write me an e-mail: myairline@ymail.com


I wish nice flights to Tenerife North.
