GCLA - La Palma Airport -second version-
----------------------------------------

How to install the scenery?

Copy or unzip all files and put it in the following folder:
Flightgear -> data -> Scenery -> Objects -> w020n20 -> w018n28

Be sure that you replace the stg-file named "2661792" otherwise it won't work later.

Have fun with many flights to La Palma Airport.
